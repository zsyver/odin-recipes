# odin-recipes
Delicious recipes developed by Odin himself.

The current project is a display of developing an extremely minimalist website design with some rudimentary web development skills (i.e. CSS and HTML).

Upon completion, the developer will be able to:

1. Create, clone, update, and commit to a GitHub repository.
2. Write the code and text necessary to display the information in a readable fashion.
3. Publish the information via the World Wide Web otherwise known as "Das Internet".
